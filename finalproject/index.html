        <p>It’s the talk of the town every season.</p>

        <p>In the early months of the NBA season, the coveted Most Valuable Player award is already heating up. </p>

        <p>At the front line of the MVP race are some familiar faces. According to Basketball Reference, 2-time MVP winner Nikola Jokic and last year’s winner Joel Embiid are favorites to win the award. Embiid and Jokic bring versatility on both ends of the court, dominate in the paint, and make their teammates better by simply being on the floor.</p>

        <p> As both centers are the top candidates for a fourth straight year, this comes as a surprise to no one. </p>

      <p>“It feels like a three-man race between Joel, Jokic , and Giannis {Antetokounmpo}”, said John Clark, sports anchor for NBC Sports Philadelphia. “As great as this is for the league, I expect more candidates to get in the conversation as the season goes on.” </p>

      <p>For Clark’s sake, so far, more candidates are worthy of the award than in recent years. The following graph shows some stats from the top MVP candidates according to Basketball Reference. </p>

      <p>Although Embiid leads the league in points per game and Jokic leads the league in rebounds, players like Luka Dončić, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jayson Tatum, and more make strong cases with their stats as well as their teams sitting in playoff positions in their respected conference. </p>

      <p>Two names you may not expect appear on this list. First is Sixers guard Tyrese Maxey, the young and electrifying point guard who’s taken a leap as the second option after James Harden’s departure earlier this season. Next is Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton, the box-office playmaker who’s known for his flashy passes and bring immediate offense when he steps on the court. 5 of the players on this list are 25 or younger, meaning the next generation of NBA stars are blooming sooner than people might have expected. </p>

      <p> As important as those stats are, there are more stats that go into consideration when picking the award winner. Listed below are some advanced stats from the MVP-worthy candidates so far in the season.</p>

        <iframe class="chartstyle2" title="Top MVP Candidates Advanced Stats" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-85sEd" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/85sEd/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="527" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
        </script>
        </div>

        <div class="col">
            <h2></h2>

            <iframe class="chartstyle2" title="Top MVP Candidates Advanced Stats" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-b3hxo" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/b3hxo/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="406" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
            </script>
                  
          </div>
      </div>
    

      <p> Now when advanced stats get involved, players have a better resume for the award. For example, not only does Tyrese Haliburton have the highest OFFRTG (offensive rating) out of the ten players, but he also has the highest OFFRTG in the entire league. Another example is Shai Gilgeous-Alexander having the lowest DEFRTG (defensive rating) out of the ten players, meaning the Oklahoma City Thunder and better defensively when he’s on the floor.</p>

      <p>Advanced stats help calculate a player’s efficiency, impact, and contribution: All which are needed to determine who’s the MVP of the league. </p>

    <p>The race for the MVP will continue to be a weekly talking point on sports television, with many analysts weighing in on the discussion. The storylines are compelling: Will Embiid for back-to-back MVPs or will Jokic give him a run for his money? Can SGA make a case as the Thunder continue to surge at the top of the west? Will any dark horses emerge as we head into the new year? </p>

    <p>The regular season hasn’t even reached its climax yet, so the race for the MVP remains wide open. All of the star players in the league will continue to leave lasting impressions as they pursue the ultimate goal: bringing the Larry O’Brien trophy back to their organization. Fans and media are going to make their input heard, knowing the winner would be etched in NBA history for their exceptional contributions during a terrific season. </p>
